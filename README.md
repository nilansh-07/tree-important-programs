## ðŸ“‚ Features Implemented

```bash
1. Tree size
2. Minimum in the tree
3. Maximum in the tree
4. Height of the tree
5. In-order traversal of the tree
6. Pre-order traversal of the tree
7. Post-order traversal of the tree
8. BFS of the tree
9. DFS of the tree
10. Left view of the tree
11. Right view of the tree
12. Top view of the tree
